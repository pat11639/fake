behind Ruby can you name? Judging from this photo taken just a few weeks ago at
<a href="http://rubykaigi.org/2013">RubyKaigi 2013</a>, the Ruby 2.0 release was a real
team effort, with commits both from the people on stage in Tokyo and hundreds
of other open source developers located around the world.</p>

<p>However, many of the most active developers behind the Ruby 2.0 release are
Japanese, largely unknown to the Ruby world outside of Japan because of the
language barrier. Recently I asked the Ruby 2.0 release manager, Yusuke Endoh,
to send a few questions to the Ruby 2.0 committers located in Japan. I was
curious who they were, what each of them worked on and what they’re like as
people. Fourteen other developers replied to his survey; read on to take a look
behind the language barrier and meet some of the people in Japan behind this
year’s Ruby 2.0 release.</p>
