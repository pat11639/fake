## Iterating Over an Array in Ruby

Here’s my example program. It’s so short and simple you can read and understand
it in just a few seconds:

<pre type="ruby">
  array = [1, 2, 3]
  for i in array
    puts i
  end
</pre>

When I ran it, the output was:

<pre class="console">
$ ruby int-loop.rb
1
2
3
</pre>
