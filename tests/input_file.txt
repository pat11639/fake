A few months ago, I saw this tweet from Steve. I'm not even sure what
"derridean" means, but now the image of an insane coach pops into my head every
time I try to write Rust code.

Learning Rust is hard for everyone, but it’s even worse for me because I’ve
been working with Ruby during past ten years. Switching to Rust from Ruby is
leaving an anything-goes hippie commune to a summer school for delinquent
programmers run by a sadistic and unforgiving teacher.

Why would anyone use a compiler like this? The answer is simple: to learn how
to write better code. This past summer I had some free time and decided to
convert a simple Ruby script into Rust. As you’ll see, the Rust compiler beat
me up a few times; it wasn’t easy. But after some tough love I ended up
learning something, not only about Rust but about Ruby too.
