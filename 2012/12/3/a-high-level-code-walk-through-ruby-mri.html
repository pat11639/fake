<p>Have you ever thought about taking at look at Ruby’s internal C source code,
but weren’t quite sure where to get started? Well, this weekend <a href="http://peterc.org">Peter Cooper</a>
and I recorded a screencast that is just for you. We went on a tour through the
MRI source code tree, and recorded it in a 33 minute screencast called: <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-mri-code-walk-tour-6020.html">A High
Level Code Walk Through Ruby
MRI</a>. We’ll give
you a “lay of the land,” a sense of what is where inside the MRI C source code
tree and suggest places to get started reading the C source code yourself.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Peter for taking time out of his busy schedule to record and
edit the video, and for being such a big fan of my book, <a href="https://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope">Ruby Under a
Microscope</a>! I’m sure you
all know Peter as the editor of <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com">Ruby Inside</a> and
<a href="http://rubyweekly.com">Ruby Weekly</a>, but he’s also recorded a number of great
screencasts. Just this June he produced the fantastic <a href="https://cooperpress.com/19walkthrough">Ruby 1.9
Walkthrough</a>, and earlier in February he
did the fun <a href="http://rubyreloaded.com/trickshots/">Ruby Trick Shots</a> piece. In
fact, Peter’s new Kickstarter project, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1225193080/the-ruby-20-walkthrough">The Ruby 2.0
Walkthrough</a>,
was backed just last week - keep an eye out for that in the coming months!
This is the first screencast I’ve ever done; having the chance to do it with
Peter was a bit like stepping onto a tennis court for the first time and
getting a private lesson from John McEnroe - or maybe Andy Murray would be a
better analogy.</p>
<p>Let us know if you like this; if enough people are interested we may do some
more screencasts on Ruby internals, diving into more detail that we had time
for this week. Enjoy!</p>
